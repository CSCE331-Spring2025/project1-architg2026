        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hey, I'm Archit Goyal, a Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M University, but honestly, the things that excite me the most are not related to circuits or code at all. I'm all about coffee, cricket, and travel‚Äîthree things that make life a whole lot more interesting. If you do want to know about me on a more technical basis, feel free to click my name or photo above to go to my LinkedIn!
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1conn5EDStlwtukKr1Ay4EbEiVSvpVfpa/view?usp=sharing">‚òï</a> Coffee: Not just Starbucks</h3>
        <p>
            Coffee isn't just a drink for me‚Äîit's a whole experience. I still remember the first time I had a truly great cup, and since then, I've been on a mission to recreate that myself. Whether it's trying out new flavors (cranberry juice and coffee believe it or not) or hunting down the best local coffee shops, I love everything about it. There's something satisfying about making the coffee yourself and getting that perfect espresso pour and then taking that first sip. It's my way of slowing down and appreciating the little things in life. P.S although I like making my own coffee, you will catch me at Starbucks much more than a regular person. Also, click on the coffee icon to see me make a white chocolate sea-salt caramel espresso!

        <h3><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thearchitgoyalll/?hl=en">‚úàÔ∏è</a> Travel: From here to there</h3>
        <p>
            I love the thrill of exploring new places‚Äîwhether it's wandering through a city's streets aimlessly, hiking to an amazing view, or just stumbling upon a hidden gem of a caf√©. Some of my best travel memories come from moments I never planned, like when I went to New York City with my roomate and decided to wait 2 hours in line for pizza just because it looked cool. That thrill of doing something unplanned made me understand that traveling isn't just about seeing places, but more about what you do with your time there. To see me travel around, click on the plane icon and follow me on Instagram!

        <h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qnCRuxMhnIvbZvA7OS--y662_W_ZivZG/view?usp=sharing">üèè</a> Cricket: Not just a game</h3>
        <p>
            
            Cricket has been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember. Growing up in India, it felt like cricket was as essential to my being as breathing and eating. Whether I'm playing a casual game with friends or watching a nail-biting game, I love the strategy, the emotion, and the excitement of it all. It's a sport that extends beyong just the game and has actually taught me so much more than just how to throw or hit a ball. Like Satya Nadella said: "I think playing cricket taught me more about working in teams and leadership that has stayed with me throughout my career". Click on the cricket icon to watch me play a little from when I went to <a href="https://sixescricket.com/en-US/social-cricket">Sixes</a> in Dallas with my coworkers from my past internship at Verizon!</p>
        <p>
            So at the end of the day, I'm just someone who enjoys a good cup of coffee, loves exploring new places, and will never turn down a chance to play or watch a game of cricket. If any of that sounds like you, I'm sure we'll get along great!
